# 3D Wireframe Viewer and Physics Simulator

This project is a Python-based 3D visualization tool that allows users to create, view, and manipulate various 3D shapes and data sources. It includes basic physics simulation capabilities and aims to become a versatile platform for 3D data visualization and animation.

## Features

- **3D Shape Generation**: Create various 3D shapes including basic geometries (cube, sphere, etc.), parametric shapes, and fractals.
- **Data Visualization**: Load and visualize data from various sources including MRI scans and super-resolution data.
- **Scene Management**: Add multiple objects to a scene, manipulate them individually or as a group.
- **Real-time Transformations**: Apply translations, rotations, and scaling to objects in real-time.
- **Display Customization**: Toggle visibility of faces, edges, and vertices. Customize colors and sizes.
- **Basic Physics Simulation**: Simulate simple physics including gravity and collisions.
- **Animation**: Animate scenes with play/pause functionality.
- **File Operations**: Save and load scenes or individual objects in various formats.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- PyQt5
- PyQtGraph
- NumPy
- (Add any other dependencies your project requires)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-wireframe-viewer.git
   cd 3d-wireframe-viewer
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script to start the application:

```
python wireframe_viewer.py
```

- Use the "Load Shape" button to add shapes to your scene.
- Manipulate shapes using the transformation controls.
- Toggle display options in the "Display Options" dialog.
- Use the play/pause button to start/stop physics simulations.

## Future Goals

- Enhanced Physics Simulation: Implement more complex physics interactions and constraints.
- Advanced Animation Tools: Add keyframe animation and shape morphing capabilities.
- Particle Systems: Implement particle effects for simulations like fire, smoke, or fluid dynamics.
- Improved Data Import: Expand supported formats for 3D data import, including point clouds and volumetric data.
- Rendering Enhancements: Add support for textures, materials, and advanced lighting models.
- Performance Optimization: Implement level-of-detail rendering and optimize for large datasets.
- Collaborative Features: Add basic networking for shared viewing sessions.
